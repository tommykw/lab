## What is KMM?
Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile(KMM) is an SDK that allows you to use the same business logic in both iOS and Android applications. It's still alpha.

The advantage is that you can share your mobile business logic. Another advantage is that the time to implement the logic has been halved.
It will reduce the implementation omissions of Android / iOS and make it easier to aim for updates at the same pace.

## Set up KMM
- Install Android Studio version 4.1 (RC 1 or higher).
- Install Xcode version 11.3 or higher.
- Install Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile plugin on Android Studio.

## Create your first KMM
- Open the Android Studio, select File | New | New Project
- Select KMM Aplication
- Specify a proecjt name 
- select androidApp, run your application on Android
- select iosApp, run your application on iOS

## Closing
It's very easy to set up with the KMM plugin. Setting gradle is difficult, but I made it without being conscious of it.
